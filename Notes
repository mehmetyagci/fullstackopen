Part 1

Creating React App

    # npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
    npm create vite@latest part1 -- --template react

    cd part1
    npm install

    npm run dev

Correct way of using console.log

    console.log('props value is', props)

Web developer's oath

    Programming is hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier

        * I will have my browser developer console open all the time
        * I progress with small steps
        * I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpoint problems
        * If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working
        * When I ask for help in the course Discord or Telegram channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly, see here how to ask for help    

npm install axios


npm install json-server --save-dev
and making a small addition to the scripts part of the package.json file:
"server": "json-server -p3001 --watch db.json"
npm run server

Full stack developer's oath
    It is again time for the exercises. The complexity of our app is now increasing since besides just taking care of the React components in the frontend, we also have a backend that is persisting the application data.

    To cope with the increasing complexity we should extend the web developer's oath to a Full stack developer's oath, which reminds us to make sure that the communication between frontend and backend happens as expected.

    So here is the updated oath:

    Full stack development is extremely hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier

    I will have my browser developer console open all the time
    I will use the network tab of the browser dev tools to ensure that frontend and backend are communicating as I expect
    I will constantly keep an eye on the state of the server to make sure that the data sent there by the frontend is saved there as I expect
    I will progress with small steps
    I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpoint problems
    If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working
    When I ask for help in the course Discord or Telegram channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly, see here how to ask for help

Nor hardcode the api-key to your source code. Instead use an environment variable to save the key.
    export VITE_SOME_KEY=54l41n3n4v41m34rv0 && npm run dev // For Linux/macOS Bash
    ($env:VITE_SOME_KEY="54l41n3n4v41m34rv0") -and (npm run dev) // For Windows PowerShell
    set "VITE_SOME_KEY=54l41n3n4v41m34rv0" && npm run dev // For Windows cmd.exe

node --inspect index.js
nodemon --inspect index.js

A true full stack developer's oath
    It is again time for the exercises. The complexity of our app has now taken another step since besides frontend and backend we also have a database. There are indeed really many potential sources of error.

    So we should once more extend our oath:

    Full stack development is extremely hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier

    I will have my browser developer console open all the time
    I will use the network tab of the browser dev tools to ensure that frontend and backend are communicating as I expect
    I will constantly keep an eye on the state of the server to make sure that the data sent there by the frontend is saved there as I expect
    I will keep an eye on the database: does the backend save data there in the right format
    I progress with small steps
    I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpoint problems
    If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working
    When I ask for help in the course Discord or Telegram channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly, see here how to ask for help
